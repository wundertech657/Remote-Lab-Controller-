This is a small project made with a Seeed XIAO RP2040. It has two modes: a stopwatch mode and an intensity mode. The device uses a 128×32 OLED display and a rotary encoder with a buttonand two extra buttons.The device can send the measured values to the computer through USB as keyboard input.
The stopwatch mode can start, stop and reset the time. When you stop it, the time shows up on the screen and you can send it to the computer. The intensity mode shows a value on the screen and you can change settings with the encoder. This value can also be sent to the computer.
The OLED shows the current mode and the numbers. The screen updates are simple and do not flicker. The encoder is used for moving between modes and for controlling things inside each mode.
The wiring is basic: the OLED goes to the I2C pins, the encoder goes to two digital pins plus one for the button, and the optional buttons go to other digital pins. Everything runs from USB‑C.
The code is split into parts: one part draws the screen, one part handles the stopwatch and intensity logic, and one part sends the HID output. The project is easy to change if you want to add more features later.
To use it, plug it into the computer, turn the encoder to choose a mode, press the button to start or stop, and the result will appear on the screen. If HID output is enabled, the value will be typed into the computer automatically.
