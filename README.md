# Raymond's Remote-Lab-Controller
This is my project for the Hack Club Blueprint. I wanted to build this because I really like chemical engineering, and many times I needed to control my laptop from a safe distance during a reaction, but I couldn’t. I also enjoy engineering in general, and I wanted to try some electrical and software engineering projects to learn more about this part of science.
# How I started the project
As I said, I didn’t have any experience, so I followed the tutorial. I chose a simple setup with two buttons, a rotary encoder, and an OLED screen.

# Schematic
After I figured out how to use KiCAD, I managed to make what I believe is a correct schematic.<img width="556" height="383" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-18 182845" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a762a09-614a-4c3a-82d6-05698339bb5c" />
# PCB
Here is where the real design started. At this point I had to make a final decision about how to arrange my components and where to place the screen, which is a critical hardware and design element of my macropad.<img width="691" height="730" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-10 145642" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fbee31b-18f4-41e7-8852-bdb461094152" />
## 
- The space above the microchip will be translucent
-  next to the encoder the whole design is symmetric and comfortable to hold.
